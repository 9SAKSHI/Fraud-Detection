#  Credit Card Fraud-Detection

This project tackles the challenging task of credit card fraud detection using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It aims to build a model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical data.

# Project Goals:

Develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.
Reduce financial losses incurred due to fraudulent activities.
Improve customer trust and security in using credit cards.

# Machine Learning Approach:

The project will explore various supervised learning algorithms commonly used for fraud detection, such as:
Logistic Regression: A solid baseline model for binary classification (fraudulent/not fraudulent).

The chosen model(s) will be trained on the labeled transaction data to learn patterns that differentiate fraudulent activities.

# Project Structure:

The project will be well-structured with clear folders for:
data: Containing the credit card transaction dataset.
scripts: Housing Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
models: Saving the trained machine learning models.
results: Storing evaluation metrics and performance reports.
README.md: This file (you're currently working on) providing an overview of the project.

# Libraries and Frameworks:

The project will leverage Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, and matplotlib for data visualization (exploratory data analysis).
